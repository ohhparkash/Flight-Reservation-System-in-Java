# Flight-Reservation-System-in-Java
A Java-based Flight Reservation System developed as part of my Semester 4 University Project.
This system simulates the core operations of a real-world flight booking system while applying fundamental data structures and algorithms.

Features
- Flight Management – Add, search, and manage flight details.
- Passenger Management – Add passengers with unique IDs, CNIC, and membership levels (Platinum, Gold, Silver, None).
- Booking & Cancellations – Reserve seats or cancel bookings.
- Waitlist Handling – Manage full flights using a queue.
- Prioritization – Use Heap Sort to prioritize waitlisted passengers based on membership levels.
- Passenger Records – Search, update, and delete passengers efficiently using a Binary Search Tree (BST).
- File Handling – Store and retrieve flight and passenger data for persistence.
- Error Handling & Validation – Ensure proper input and smooth system flow.

Technologies & Tools
- Language: Java
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code 
- Core Concepts:
- Arrays (for flight storage)
- Linked List (for passenger queue)
- Queue (FIFO structure for waitlists)
- Binary Search Tree (passenger records)
- Heap Sort (priority handling of waitlists)

Data Structures & Algorithms
- Queue Operations – Enqueue/Dequeue passengers in O(1).
- Binary Search Tree (BST) – Search, insert, delete passengers in O(log n).
- Heap Sort – Prioritize waitlisted passengers in O(n log n).

Project Significance
This project demonstrates practical application of:
- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Handling in Java
- System Design & Error Handling
- It reflects how academic knowledge can be applied to simulate real-world systems.
